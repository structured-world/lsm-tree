/// Builds a BuRR filter from a key set.

/// # Construction sketch
///
/// For each layer (0 to `max_layers - 1`):
///   1. Hash every input key with the layer's derived seed to produce a
///      `StandardEquation` (gives `start = block_idx * b + offset`).
///   2. Run `compute_thresholds` over those equations to pick per-block
///      threshold `τ_i`. A key with `offset < τ_i` is KEPT in this layer;
///      a key with `offset >= τ_i` is BUMPED to the next layer.
///   3. Partition keys into `kept` and `bumped` via
///      `partition_keys_by_threshold`.
///   4. Build a vendored Standard Ribbon over `kept` — the threshold
///      scheme caps per-block load to ~90%, so this build almost always
///      succeeds outright; a key the membership solve still cannot place
///      is bumped like any other.
///   5. Push `BurrLayer { thresholds, ribbon }` onto the layer stack.
///   6. Recurse with `remaining = bumped`.
///
/// The last layer has no next layer to bump into, so it forces
/// `thresholds[..] = b` (accept everything) and is sized with an enlarged
/// `m` so the Ribbon build absorbs its residual. A key it still cannot
/// place surfaces as `LayerExhaustion` rather than going missing.
