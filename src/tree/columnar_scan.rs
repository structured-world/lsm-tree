//! Tree-level projected columnar scan.
//!
//! Lifts the per-SST [`Table::columnar_scan`](crate::Table::columnar_scan) to the
//! whole tree: a consumer holding a [`Tree`] (or an
//! [`AnyTree`](crate::AnyTree)) can run a projected, predicate-pushed columnar
//! scan across every columnar segment intersecting a key range and visible at an
//! MVCC snapshot, without reimplementing segment selection, snapshot visibility,
//! delete-masking, or cross-segment ordering.
//!
//! # Strategy (overlap-aware merge)
//!
//! A row's effective sequence number is `local_seqno + global_seqno`. Bulk
//! ingested segments carry a *uniform per-segment* seqno (every local seqno is
//! `0`, one `global_seqno` per table), so their visibility is segment-granular;
//! flush-produced segments carry per-row seqnos, so a snapshot can straddle them.
//! A projected seqno column is emitted in that EFFECTIVE (tree-global) space,
//! which is what every other read surface speaks: the stored local value would
//! read as `0` for an ingested row and name a commit the tree never had. The
//! masking arithmetic still runs in local space (one subtraction per segment
//! instead of one addition per row), so only the emitted column is translated.
//! The visible columnar segments overlapping the range are grouped by key-range
//! overlap:
//!
//! - A **singleton** group (a segment whose key range overlaps no other) whose
//!   rows are all visible AND provably one-version-per-key (the writer's
//!   distinct-key count equals its row count) streams its
//!   [`Table::columnar_scan`](crate::Table::columnar_scan) batches verbatim —
//!   zero-copy column-skip, no key decode, no row gather. A singleton the
//!   snapshot straddles gets a per-row seqno mask first, and one that can hold
//!   several versions of a key (an overwritten key in a flush / compaction
//!   product) additionally gets per-key newest-visible dedup.
//! - An **overlapping** group is row-merged: the projection is augmented with the
//!   intrinsic key + seqno columns, each segment's rows are visibility-masked and
//!   tagged with their effective seqno, the union is sorted by `(key asc,
//!   effective seqno desc)`, and the first (newest) row of each key is kept. The
//!   expensive key/seqno decode + gather is paid only where segments overlap.
//!
//! Groups are emitted in ascending key order, so the scan yields projected
//! [`ColumnBatch`]es in global key order. This mirrors how `InfluxDB` `IOx`
//! inserts its deduplication operator only over overlapping files and engineers
//! compaction to keep files non-overlapping: as multi-segment columnar compaction
//! reduces overlap, more of the scan takes the zero-cost singleton path.
//!
//! Deletes reach the scan two ways and both remove the key. A segment's
//! positional delete-bitmap is applied inside
//! [`Table::columnar_scan`](crate::Table::columnar_scan); a value-type TOMBSTONE
//! is consumed here, when the newest visible version of a key is one — the key
//! then yields no row at all, matching what a point read reports, instead of
//! surfacing a row a caller who did not project the value-type column could not
//! tell from a live one. Only a segment that RECORDS deletions pays for it: one
//! whose metadata counts none keeps its columns untouched (and its zero-copy
//! verbatim path). Memtable rows are not consulted —
//! columnar data lives only in segments — and a visible non-columnar segment
//! overlapping the range is rejected (a mixed-mode tree is unsupported here).
