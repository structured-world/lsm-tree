//! Implementation of [`Tree::create_checkpoint`](crate::Tree::create_checkpoint)
//! and [`BlobTree::create_checkpoint`](crate::BlobTree::create_checkpoint).
//!
//! A checkpoint is a hard-linked, fully-functional snapshot of the tree's
//! on-disk state. It can be opened independently via
//! [`Config::open`](crate::Config::open) without affecting the source tree.
//!
//! The algorithm mirrors `RocksDB`'s `Checkpoint::CreateCheckpoint`:
//!
//! 1. Acquire a [`Pause`](crate::deletion_pause::Pause) on the source tree's
//!    deletion gate. Compaction continues, but obsolete files queued for
//!    removal are held back until the checkpoint is complete.
//! 2. Flush the active memtable so all live data is in SSTs.
//! 3. Snapshot the current `Version`; iterate its tables (and blob files,
//!    for [`BlobTree`](crate::blob_tree::BlobTree)) and hard-link each one into `target/tables/` (or
//!    `target/blobs/`).
//! 4. Copy the manifest, version file (`v<id>`), and `current` pointer.
//! 5. Drop the pause guard — queued deletions run.

// `Path`, `io::{Read, Write}` and `io::copy` come from `std::*` because
// no `core` / `alloc` equivalents exist; they are also the same types
// the underlying `Fs` trait operates on, so this module inherits its
// host `fs` module's std dependency rather than introducing a new one.
