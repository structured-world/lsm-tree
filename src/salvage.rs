//! Block-granular SST salvage: recover the readable blocks of an SST whose
//! whole-file verification fails, dropping the corrupted ones.
//!
//! Where [`crate::repair`] rebuilds the manifest *around* unreadable SSTs and
//! [`crate::verify`] reports per-block health read-only, salvage walks an SST
//! block-by-block, re-emits every data block that passes its checksum (and ECC
//! recovery where present) into a fresh, fully-valid SST, and reports the key
//! ranges it had to drop. A single corrupted block then costs only its own key
//! range instead of the whole file.
//!
//! The salvaged SST is written through the normal [`crate::table`] writer, so
//! it carries fresh per-block checksums, a fresh index, and a fresh filter:
//! the corruption is not propagated into the recovered copy.

/// The walk is positional (block-index order): iteration is not
