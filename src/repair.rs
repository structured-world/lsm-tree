//! Last-resort `MANIFEST` reconstruction from the SST files on disk.
//!
//! Once a tree has a `MANIFEST`, that manifest is a single point of failure for
//! the database as a whole: a corrupt manifest means the tree cannot open at
//! all, even when every SST on disk is intact. Repair scans the table folder(s),
//! reads each SST's own metadata, and writes a fresh manifest referencing what
//! is actually present.
//!
//! ## What is recovered, what is lost
//!
//! Every readable SST is preserved. What the rebuilt manifest cannot know is the
//! LSM level structure (which file lived at which level) and any version edits
//! that had not yet been durably logged (an in-flight compaction's output
//! placement, recent table deletions). Following the RocksDB `RepairDB()`
//! pattern, all recovered SSTs are placed at L0 ordered by sequence number
//! (newest first) and a normal background compaction redistributes them into
//! proper levels on the next open. Reads are correct throughout: L0 permits
//! overlapping runs, and the merge reader resolves the latest value by sequence
//! number regardless of physical placement.
//!
//! ## Correctness of the recomputed table checksum
//!
//! The manifest binds each table by its whole-file XXH3-128 checksum. A normal
//! write computes that digest incrementally as the file is streamed out, and the
//! file is written strictly sequentially (no seek-back rewrites after the digest
//! is taken), so the on-disk bytes equal the hashed byte stream. Repair therefore
//! recomputes the identical digest by streaming the file start to end. The data
//! itself is protected independently by per-block checksums, which
//! [`Table::recover`] validates as it parses, so an SST that survives recovery is
//! structurally sound.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! KV-separated (blob) trees are supported: the `blobs/` folder is scanned to
//! rediscover the blob files and record them in the rebuilt manifest. Blob-file
//! fragmentation statistics cannot be reconstructed from a directory scan
//! (they are derived from compaction history), so they start empty; blob GC is
//! advisory and re-learns reclaimable space over time without dropping data.
