//! Bump-allocating arena for skiplist node storage.
//!
//! All node data (metadata, keys, tower pointers) is allocated from a single
//! contiguous byte buffer via an atomic bump pointer.  This gives better cache
//! locality than per-node heap allocation and enables O(1) bulk deallocation
//! when the memtable is dropped.

/// bump pointer.  Once allocated, regions are immutable (written once during
/// node construction, then read concurrently).  Tower entries are the exception
