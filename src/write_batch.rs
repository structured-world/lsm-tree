//! Write batch for bulk memtable insertion with shared seqno.
//!
//! A [`WriteBatch`] collects multiple write operations (insert, remove, merge)
//! and applies them to the active memtable with a single seqno.
//! This reduces per-operation overhead:
//!
//! - **One version-history lock** acquisition instead of N
//! - **Batch size accounting**: single `fetch_add` for total size
//! - **Shared seqno**: all entries in a batch share the same sequence number
//!
//! **Visibility contract:** entries are inserted into the memtable one at a time
//! and become individually visible to concurrent readers as they are written.
//! Atomic batch visibility requires the **caller** to publish the batch seqno
//! (via `visible_seqno.fetch_max(batch_seqno + 1)`) only **after**
//! [`AbstractTree::apply_batch`] returns. This is the same pattern used by
//! fjall's keyspace for single-writer batches.

    /// Write a merge operand for a key.
    Merge { key: UserKey, value: UserValue },
}

/// Batch of write operations applied with a shared seqno.
///
/// **Duplicate keys:** all entries receive the same seqno. The memtable
/// skiplist orders by `(user_key, Reverse(seqno))` — `value_type` does NOT
/// break ties. Two entries with the same `(user_key, seqno)` compare equal
/// regardless of operation type, so one may silently overwrite the other.
///
/// - **Repeated `merge()` on the same key:** safe. All merge operands are
///   collected during reads regardless of skiplist position.
/// - **Mixed ops on the same key** (e.g. `insert` + `remove`): not allowed.
///   `materialize()` rejects these batches with `Error::MixedOperationBatch`
///   in all builds. Callers must canonicalize mixed-op duplicates into a
///   single final operation before batching.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use lsm_tree::WriteBatch;
///
/// let mut batch = WriteBatch::new();
/// batch.insert("key1", "value1");
/// batch.insert("key2", "value2");
/// batch.remove("key3");
///
/// assert_eq!(batch.len(), 3);
/// assert!(!batch.is_empty());
