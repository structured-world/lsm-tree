//! Pluggable filesystem abstraction for I/O backends.
//!
//! The [`Fs`] trait abstracts all filesystem operations that lsm-tree
//! performs, allowing alternative backends such as io_uring, in-memory
//! filesystems for deterministic testing, or cloud blob storage.
//!
//! The default implementation [`StdFs`] delegates to [`std::fs`] and
//! is a zero-sized type, so it adds no runtime overhead when used as a
//! monomorphized generic parameter.
