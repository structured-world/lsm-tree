//! Bottommost sequence-number zeroing for compaction output.
//!
//! At the last level an entry whose seqno is already below the GC watermark (no
//! live snapshot needs it) can have its seqno set to `0` — "0" packs to a single
//! byte, and sequence numbers grow monotonically, so this saves space on the
//! coldest, largest level.
//!
//! ## Why a range-tombstone gate is required (MVCC / PITR safety)
//!
//! Range tombstones are applied at read time by sequence-number comparison: a
//! tombstone `RT@r` suppresses an entry `K@s` iff it covers `K` and `s < r`. If
//! we zero `K@s` to `K@0`, then **any** covering tombstone with `r > 0` would
//! suppress it — including:
//!   - a tombstone older than the entry (`r < s`), which must NOT suppress it; and
//!   - a tombstone newer than the entry (`r > s`) but with `r` above the
//!     watermark, which must stay visible for snapshots in `[watermark, r)`.
//!
//! So a key is zeroed only when **no range tombstone in the whole version covers
//! it**. Tombstones are gathered from every level (not just this compaction's
//! inputs), so a tombstone in a level that is not part of this compaction still
//! blocks zeroing — the "beyond output level" case.
//!
//! ## Which reads this is allowed to be invisible to
//!
//! For KEY AND VALUE visibility: none above the watermark, which is the whole
//! of the permission. A rewritten entry answers snapshots between `0` and its
//! real seqno that it never answered before, and every entry rewritten here is
//! below the watermark, so the install's floor refuses AT LEAST those snapshots
//! after a reopen. A snapshot at or above the watermark resolves to the same
//! entry as before, since a zeroed seqno still loses to any real one.
//!
//! The seqno ITSELF is not covered by that, and deliberately so. A columnar
//! scan can project `COL_SEQNO`, which is returned in tree-global space, so a
//! scan at any snapshot reports `0` for a rewritten row where it used to report
//! the real seqno. That is the point of the rewrite (one byte instead of a
//! varint on the coldest level) and it is why the column is a physical
//! encoding detail rather than a value the engine promises to preserve. A
//! caller that needs a stable per-row seqno must store one of its own.
//!
//! At least, and usually more: the floor is `(watermark - 1)` capped at the
//! install's own seqno, derived from a boolean that says only THAT something
//! was rewritten. Zeroing one entry at seqno 10 under a watermark of 100 and
//! an install at 50 refuses every snapshot through 50, though only key/value
//! reads through 10 changed. That is the safe direction and the deliberate one;
//! the gate below is what keeps it safe, not the floor's precision.
//!
//! That coupling is why the gate is `seqno < gc_seqno_threshold` and not, say,
//! the output level's own bounds: an entry rewritten at or above the watermark
//! would change an answer the recorded floor still promises.
//!
//! Zeroing the bottom version itself is PITR-safe: it only applies to the
//! latest entry below the watermark (no snapshot reads below the watermark), and
//! a newer version (real seqno > 0) always wins the merge over the zeroed one.
//! Older-version ambiguity cannot arise at the last level for the same reason
//! [`CompactionStream::evict_tombstones`](crate::compaction::stream::CompactionStream::evict_tombstones) relies on: the last level is the
//! authoritative bottom.
