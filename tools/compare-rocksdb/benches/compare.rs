//! Head-to-head comparison harness: `coordinode-lsm-tree` vs RocksDB.
//!
//! Each criterion group runs the same workload through both engines
//! and produces side-by-side timings for the gh-pages dashboard
//! (per [#244]). The harness intentionally mirrors
//! `structured-zstd`'s `compare_ffi.rs` shape so the merge / chart
//! scripts in `.github/scripts/` are byte-for-byte reusable. The
//! `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` operator guide lands in a follow-up commit
//! on this branch alongside the gh-pages workflow port.
//!
//! [#244]: https://github.com/structured-world/coordinode-lsm-tree/issues/244
//!
//! Run locally:
//!
//! ```text
//! cd tools/compare-rocksdb && cargo bench
//! ```
//!
//! On macOS, `librocksdb-sys`'s `bindgen` build script needs to
//! find `libclang.dylib`. Brew's LLVM puts it under
//! `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib`; export both
//! `LIBCLANG_PATH` (bindgen) and `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`
//! (dyld for the build-script binary) before invoking cargo:
//!
//! ```text
//! export LIBCLANG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib
//! export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib
//! cd tools/compare-rocksdb && cargo bench
//! ```
//!
//! Linux CI uses the distro `libclang.so` which `bindgen` finds
//! without env-var help.
//!
//! ## Criterion settings come from the command line
//!
//! Sample count, warm-up and measurement window are NOT set in code: the
//! groups inherit whatever the Criterion CLI passes (the benchmark workflow
//! runs `--sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 0.5`). A
//! group-level `sample_size(..)` silently overrides the CLI, and with the
//! cold-write arms costing seconds per iteration (RocksDB at zstd-22 writes
//! 10k rows in ~5 s) a 100-sample default turns a one-minute arm into ten.
//!
//! Warm read arms build their on-disk state ONCE per arm (see
//! [`WarmEngine`]): Criterion re-enters a `bench_with_input` routine
//! closure for the warm-up pass and for every sample, so anything built
//! inside the closure is rebuilt once per sample.
//!
//! ## Engine matrix
//!
//! The shared workload closure is parameterised over an [`Engine`]
//! enum so the per-engine glue (open, put, get, flush, close) lives
//! in exactly one place per engine and the workload code stays
//! engine-agnostic. Three engines today: `ours`, `rocksdb`, and
//! `surrealkv` (pure-Rust embedded LSM/MVCC). SurrealKV has no zstd
//! codec, so it overlays ONLY on the `None`-compression groups (see
//! [`engines_for`]); the `_zstd22` groups stay ours-vs-rocksdb.
//!
//! ## Compression axis + cross-engine overlay
//!
//! Every scenario is run twice: once with `None` block compression
//! (the `<scenario>` group) and once with zstd at level 22, the maximum
//! "ultra" level (the `<scenario>_zstd22` group). Both engines are
//! configured identically per variant — ours via
//! `CompressionType::Zstd(22)`, RocksDB via `DBCompressionType::Zstd`
//! pinned to level 22 — so the no-compression and high-ratio paths sit
//! side-by-side on the dashboard.
//!
//! Within each group every engine runs in the SAME process and the SAME
//! invocation, so criterion plots them as an overlay (ours vs rocksdb,
//! plus surrealkv on the `None` groups) on one chart. Because the
//! comparison is a ratio measured on one host in one run, it stays
//! meaningful even if the bench host's CPU changes between runs — the
//! absolute numbers move, the relative gap does not.
//!
//! ## Workload coverage
//!
//! - `write_throughput/{1k,10k,70k}` — bulk insert N keys, 256-byte
//!   values, random keys. Cold-start: each iteration opens an empty
//!   engine, writes N, flushes. Dominated by the fixed open + flush
//!   cost at small N.
//! - `point_read/{1k,10k,70k}` — read N random keys from an engine
//!   pre-populated with N keys and flushed to disk. Warm: the engine
//!   is opened + populated + flushed ONCE outside the timed window,
//!   so the measurement is steady-state read latency (block cache +
//!   bloom filter + on-disk block fetch), not setup cost. The `ours` /
//!   `rocksdb` series use a binary-search data-block index; the same chart
//!   overlays `ours-hash-index` / `rocksdb-hash-index` series (data-block
//!   hash index ON — ours: 1.33 buckets/entry; RocksDB: `BinaryAndHash` @
//!   0.75) and an `ours-ribbon` series (retrieval-ribbon locator: key ->
//!   block + restart in O(1), skipping both the index-block and in-block
//!   searches) so every index strategy is compared head-to-head on one plot.
//! - `range_scan/{1k,10k,70k}` — full forward scan reading every value
//!   from a warm, pre-populated engine. Steady-state sequential-scan
//!   throughput (block decode + iterator advance).
//! - `seek_random/{1k,10k,70k}` — seek to each (scattered) key and read
//!   the value at the cursor, on a warm engine. Seek-then-read latency
//!   (index descent + cursor positioning + block decode).
//! - `overwrite/{1k,10k,70k}` — rewrite the whole keyspace into an engine
//!   that already holds one copy (the first copy is written outside the
//!   timed window). Overwrite cost (memtable churn over existing keys +
//!   a superseding flush), distinct from cold first-insert.
//!
//! Each of the above also has a `_zstd22` sibling. Not yet portable
//! head-to-head: `readwhilewriting` (concurrency) and `mergerandom`
//! (merge-operator semantics differ across engines) from [#244]'s list.
